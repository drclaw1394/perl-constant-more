Revision history for Perl extension constant::more

0.1.2 2022-12-19
  [Bug fixes]
  - Existing constant checking would only consider constants created by
    constant::more and would attempt to redefine constants if they already
    existed from other packages. This is fixed by only exporting a constant if
    the target package doesn't have an existing glob CODE slot.
