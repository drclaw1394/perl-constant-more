Revision history for Perl extension constant::more
v0.2.1  2023-08-27
  [improvements]
  - only load Getopt::Long if the opt field is used AND if there are arguments to process in @ARGV

v0.2.0 2023-07-25
  [improvements]
    - Trimmed unneeded fat by removing List::Util, Exporter and Carp and state
      feature.

0.1.2 2022-12-19
  [Bug fixes]
  - Existing constant checking would only consider constants created by
    constant::more and would attempt to redefine constants if they already
    existed from other packages. This is fixed by only exporting a constant if
    the target package doesn't have an existing glob CODE slot.
